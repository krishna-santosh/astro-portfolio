Hello and welcome to my blog! My name is Krishna Santosh and I am excited to share my thoughts, experiences, and passions with you.

I have always had a love for writing and sharing my perspective with others, though this is my first time doing this, I guess this will be a great learning experience, and I am thrilled to have the opportunity to do so through this blog.

I will be covering a variety of topics on this blog, including Programming, Free and OpenSource Software, Linux, and Amateur astronomy. 

I hope that my blog will provide a platform for me to share my knowledge and experiences on these topics with others who are interested in learning more about them. I am looking forward to connecting with my readers and hearing their thoughts and perspectives as well. I am excited to see where this journey of blogging takes me and am grateful for the opportunity to share my passions with others. 

Thank you for joining me on this journey and I hope you will continue to follow my blog for updates and new content.
